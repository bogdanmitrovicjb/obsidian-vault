- set up asdf instead of chruby (works great) and connected it to RubyMine
- installed correct ruby versions, gems and everything 
- read about both projects from README files
- got familiar with gems and the way ruby handles them (Gemfile)
- ran both projects and got familiar with the architecture patterns used (MVC)
## TODO
